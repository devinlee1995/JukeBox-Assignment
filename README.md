# JukeBox-Assignment

In order to run this JukeBox, download the zip file from gitHub  and open the index.html file for any internet browser. 

For this simple JukeBox, there is a screen listing the current song playing, the current state of the song, and a list of available songs.
When a song is playing, it is highlighted in a different color.

A user can click three possible buttons. The green button is a play button that plays a stopped or paused. The blue button is a pause 
button that pauses a playing song. Lastly, the red button is a stop button that completely stops the current song and loads the next one
in the playlist. 

The user can also click a song in the playlist to choose what song to play.
